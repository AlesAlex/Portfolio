As part of my internship, I ported, integrated and optimized a routing system developed in **Java** into a larger **web application** built with **JavaScript**. 
Following this, I extended the routing system and transformed it into my final degree project, a 3D simulator of an intelligent on-demand self-driving real-time vehicle assignment system 
made with **Unity**. During my internship, I gained experience with the following skills and technologies:
* Unity 3D.
* C#.
* MySQL.
* MongoDB.
* JavaScript.
* Node.js.
* Java.
* Closely collaborated with developers from other teams such as AI, backend, network and research teams.
